# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
puts 5

# Perform simple math with numbers
puts 5 + 3
puts 5 - 3
puts 5 * 3
puts 5 / 3
puts 5 % 3
puts 5.0 / 3.0

# Strings
puts "Hello, world!"

# Combine strings together
puts "Hello," + " world!"
puts "Tacos" * 3

# Variables
a = 5
b = 3
puts 5 * 3

# Combine strings and variables
food = "tacos"
quantity = 3
puts food + ": " + quantity.to_s

# String manipulation
puts "#{food}: #{quantity}"
puts "Hello".reverse
puts "Hello".downcase
